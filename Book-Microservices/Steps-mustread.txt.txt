--------------------Dockerize the node app microservice and mongoDB -----------------

core concept is,

create a node app microservice 

write the logics for CRUD opration on books details

backend DB is mongoDB 


--------------------------------------------------------
now pull the mongoDB image from docker hub
docker pull mongo:latest

by default mongodb will run in th localhost:27017

so we have mongodb dokcer image now and it is running in 27017 

now we need to run the docker image for mongodb from 27017 to 27018 by using port mapping like below

docker run --name mongo76 -p 27018:27017 -d mongo:7.0.6

after success of this our mongodb running in localhost:27018. YOu check this in mongoDB GUI compass. 
Now mongodb docker image will create docker container check using docker ps

after all this we need to check mongodb container running ipaddress for connection string in node app

for this 
docker inspect <containerId>
(containerid) you will get from docker ps => mongodb container

after this we can update our env file with 
mongodbURI: mongodb://172.17.0.2:27017/BOOKS(if mongodb container running in localhost you can mark mongodb://0.0.0.0/BOOKS)

once connected please check mongoDB compass it will create new DB name called BOOKS

---------------------------------connection done-------------------------------------

---------------------------------create docker file for nodeapp -----------------------
refer docker file in the folder

once created do build 

docker build -t nodejsbookmicroservice .

once build success do run the docker image in 8080 port (mentioned in dockler file )
docker run -p 8080:8080 nodejsbookmicroservice (mapped to 8080)

now mongodb and node app running in diff container's and connected each other conenction bridge
http://localhost:8081/api/v1/book/add
http://localhost:8081/api/v1/books 

check in postman...

later days, 
now you can go your powershell 
check docker ps 
docker images

run the container based on the tag name you can access this app, no need to run in local
